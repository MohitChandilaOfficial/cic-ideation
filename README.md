# CiC-Ideation
Consumer Initiated Contracts, hereafter refered to as CiC, is being proposed as a protocol and set of clauses, installed on end-user systems, which is intended to counter broad and generic consent curated and misused by online apps and platforms.

Consumer-Initiated Contracts (CiCs) represent a paradigm shift in how agreements are formed between consumers and service providers.  Instead of being presented with lengthy, often incomprehensible, standard contracts, CiCs empower individuals to define and control the terms they find acceptable. This enhances accountability for service providers and ensures that consumer needs are at the forefront of every transaction.

# How it works?

CiCs operate through a standardized framework that allows consumers to create and manage their contract terms. Here's a breakdown:

  **Contract Creation**: Consumers use dedicated software or platforms on their devices to select and customize pre-approved contract clauses. These clauses cover various aspects of the service, such as data privacy, usage limitations, liability, and dispute resolution.

  **Customization**: The platform offers a range of options, allowing consumers to tailor the clauses to their unique circumstances. For example, a user might restrict data collection to specific purposes or set stricter data retention policies.

  **Contract Storage**: The customized contract is securely stored on the consumer's device, acting as their 'source of truth' for the agreement.
Provider Query: Before installing any software or service, the provider can query the consumer's device (with explicit consent) to retrieve the CiC. This allows the provider to understand the consumer's requirements and determine if they can meet them.

  **Agreement & Execution**: If the provider agrees to the CiC terms, the service is installed, and the contract is digitally signed by both parties. This ensures that the provider is legally bound to uphold the consumer's customized terms.


# Key Features

  **Customizable Clauses**:  A library of pre-approved, legally sound contract clauses that consumers can mix and match to create personalized agreements.

  **Device Integration**: Seamless integration with consumer devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.) for easy contract customization and management.

  **Provider API**: A robust API that allows service providers to efficiently query and retrieve consumer contract preferences.

  **Transparency & Auditability**:  A clear audit trail of all contract modifications and interactions, ensuring transparency and accountability.

# Benefits to Community and Internet Users

CiCs offer significant advantages across various segments of the population:

  **Empowerment**: Puts individuals in control of their agreements, fostering a sense of ownership and agency.
  
  **Accountability**: Holds service providers accountable to consumer needs and preferences.
  
  **Accessibility**: Makes contracts more accessible and understandable, particularly for individuals with limited literacy or legal expertise.

  **Reduced Disputes**: Clear, customized agreements minimize misunderstandings and potential disputes.
